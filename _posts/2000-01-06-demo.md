We provide a demo video showing qualitative results of the PixelEDL implementation in the MineRL and Habitat AI environments. The agents skills (policies being learnt) are conditioned with the  discovered representative latent variables of the spatial features of the state space. In the video we explicitly show the actual conditioning latent variable for each episode.
